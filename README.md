# Visual Analytics Dashboard
Welcome to the group 13 visual analytics dashboard repository!
This dashboard is created using [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction) and [plotly express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/) for the visualization elements and used pandas/numpy for data processing.

The data used for this project is from the [2017 VAST challenge](http://visualdata.wustl.edu/varepository/VAST%20Challenge%202017/challenges/Grand%20Challenge/)
